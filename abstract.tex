Human dectection is an important technique used in many other problems such as traffic control, movies' features extracting, etc. However, it's hard to detect the whole body because the lower part is usually obscured by other objects like bikes, cars, tables, etc. This motivates us to use R-CNN to detect upper-body of the target. The experimental result using this technique achieves the accuracy of 95.5 \%. The dataset consists of 300 images. People in these images are from different ages and have different angles. This method can be improved by using better dataset.
